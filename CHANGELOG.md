# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-08-04

### Features
- **Real label colors from the API** — The Labels column now renders each label with its actual color returned by `glab label list` / `gh label list` (hex, normalized and persisted in the offline cache). GitHub-style background-fill colors that are too light to read as foreground text automatically fall back to the theme palette, which now ships full 10-entry palettes across all 16 bundled themes. A new `fetch_label_colors` config option (default `true`) switches back to always using the theme palette (#295).
- **Complete theme coverage** — Every remaining hardcoded RGB value was replaced with semantic theme tokens so all surfaces honor the active theme: the diff view (unified and side-by-side addition/deletion lines, gutters, separators, empty panes, draft/current comment overlays, file-tree stats), markdown rendering (headings, list bullets, blockquotes, code), and the diff selection/search-match highlight backgrounds (#295).

### Bug Fixes
- **Windows CI test race** — Unit tests that mutate process-global environment variables (config paths, cache dirs) are now serialized on a shared `config::TEST_ENV_MUTEX`, eliminating an intermittent `page_size` assertion failure on Windows where one test's `GLAB_TUI_CONFIG` mutation leaked into another test's `Config::load()` (#296).

### Maintenance
- **Release tooling** — `scripts/release.sh` gained animated spinner and progress-bar helpers: preflight checks, release builds, demo-GIF generation, PR-merge polling, and the branch push now run with a live spinner and captured logs (auto-disabled when not a TTY), and release phases are numbered (`1/7` …) for clearer progress reporting (#296).
- **Documentation** — README package-manager version badges (crates.io, GitHub releases, Homebrew, Scoop, Docker) consolidated into the header badge row, and the Homebrew badge re-pointed at the main repo's release tags (the tap repo publishes no releases of its own).
- **Dependencies** — `toml` bumped `1.1.3` → `1.1.4` (#292); CI Actions `docker/login-action` `4.5.2` → `4.6.0` (#293) and `actions/stale` `10.4.0` → `11.0.0` (#294).

## [0.8.2] - 2026-08-02

### Features
- **MR/PR review state at a glance** — The MR/PR table now surfaces **Approval** (`CHG`/`CHANGES`, `AWAITING`, `APPROVED`, `REVIEW REQ`), **Mergeable** (`CONFLICT`, `REBASE`, `CLEAN`, `CHECKING`), and **Workflow** (`Returned`, `Review req`, `Yours`, `Approved`, `By others`, `Inactive`) columns with color-coded icon badges, reordered so the status indicators sit together at the front of the table. GitLab state comes from a single bulk GraphQL query; GitHub derives it from the native `gh pr list` review/merge fields. Pending approvals repeat one icon per approval still needed, and GitLab's `blocking_discussions_resolved` flag is surfaced alongside (#270, #274).
- **Rebase & revoke approvals** — `R` rebases the source branch onto the target on both hosts (gated by mergeability: conflicted MRs must be resolved locally, already-clean MRs are skipped), and `A` revokes your approval on GitLab (`gh` has no revoke path) — both behind the standard confirm popup (#270).
- **Filter picker aligned with the table** — Value-based column filter selectors now show the exact text the table renders (`OPEN`/`CLOSED`, `CONFLICT`/`REBASE`/`CLEAN`, `SUCCESS`/`FAILED`, …). Legacy lowercase values already saved in `config.toml` or the cache keep working through automatic `normalize_filter_value()` normalization (#274).
- **`api_per_page` configuration** — New `api_per_page` key bounds the per-request response size (clamped to GitLab's accepted `1–100` `per_page` range) for issues, MRs, pipelines, and labels — a workaround for GitLab instances that truncate large JSON response bodies (#269, #272).
- **Rosé Pine themes** — Three new bundled presets: `rose-pine`, `rose-pine-moon`, and `rose-pine-dawn` (16 bundled themes total) (#278).
- **Theme polish** — The root canvas background is now painted for every theme, the `default` and `clean` presets use pure black backgrounds, and the light-theme demo GIF was re-recorded. The hardcoded in-code fallback theme was removed: `Theme::default()` now derives directly from `src/themes/default.toml`, so the bundled TOML is the single source of truth (#282).

### Bug Fixes
- **Milestone removal & attribute clearing** — Milestones can now be removed (empty / `None` selector value) and attributes cleared from the edit menu and bulk updates, and the premature tab-refresh race after edit submission was eliminated (#281).
- **Cached filter compatibility** — Pre-existing saved column filters stored with the old lowercase display values are normalized transparently, so no config or cache migration is required after upgrading (#274).
- **Overlay & diff view backgrounds** — Popup overlays (edit menus, selectors, confirm dialogs, column filters) and the diff view now paint the active theme background instead of resetting to the terminal default color, so every surface renders consistently with the chosen theme on terminals whose default background differs from `bg`.

### Maintenance
- **Release tooling** — `scripts/release.sh` now interactively selects the opencode model (provider → model → variant) used for regenerated docs and release notes, via `fzf` with a numbered-menu fallback; set `OPENCODE_MODEL` to skip the prompt (#283).
- **Test robustness** — `workflow_dispatch` input parsing now tests against an inline fixture instead of reading a repository workflow file (#271); new unit tests cover MR keybinding collision detection, bundled-theme parsing, `api_per_page` clamping, MR state derivation, and filter normalization.
- **Documentation** — Backend docs describe `_per_request` semantics (no-op on GitHub, which paginates via `--limit`), and the generated `config.toml` documents `api_per_page`; the README CI badge now points at `rust.yml` (#272).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- **Nested GitLab subgroups** — Remote project paths are now parsed by a shared `git_helpers::parse_project_path` that preserves the full namespace path instead of truncating to the last two segments. Projects in nested subgroup namespaces (e.g. `group/subgroup/project`) on self-hosted GitLab no longer fail with "Project Not Found"; the parser also handles `ssh://` URLs, explicit ports, and embedded credentials, and the offline cache is keyed identically (#256).
- **Review submission popup** — Submitting a review with pending draft comments now uses the standard confirmation popup with styled `[ YES ]` / `[ NO ]` buttons (`h`/`l` to toggle, `Enter`/`y` to confirm, `n`/`Esc` to cancel) instead of the bare `y`/`n` keybinds, consistent with every other destructive action (#247, #248).
- **Pipeline creation with variables** — Fixed the `glab ci run` flag name (`--variable` → `--variables`) and stopped passing `--mr` when custom variables or `workflow_dispatch` inputs are set, so pipelines triggered with variables/inputs now run correctly (#258).
- **Release build caching** — `rust-cache` is skipped on release tag builds to avoid restoring stale caches, and the git identity is configured before the Homebrew/Scoop manifest commits (#260, #264).

### Changed
- **Local-first release orchestration** — All release automation consolidated into a single `scripts/release.sh` orchestrator: preflight checks, version bump, doc and demo-GIF regeneration via headless `opencode`, a `chore: prepare release` PR with a review gate, squash-merge and tag, release build wait, release notes with contributor attribution, Homebrew/Scoop manifest sync, GHCR image push, and crates.io publish. The `prepare-release` and `post-release` workflows were removed; `release.yml` now only builds the cross-platform binary matrix.
- **CI hardening** — All third-party GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs (versions kept as comments for update tooling) so no step can be re-pointed to unreviewed code; `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` now takes an explicit `toolchain` input (#250).
- **Filtering & keybinding documentation** — README expanded with a Filtering, Grouping & Columns walkthrough and complete per-tab keybinding tables (including the remappable `config.toml` key for every binding); the in-app `?` help overlay surfaces the configure/filter workflow, and stale shortcuts (pipeline artifact download, milestone `J`/`K`) were removed (#261).
- **Dead code removal** — Removed the unused `KeybindingPipelines.download_artifact` config key (no handler exists; `d` cancels) and the never-invoked `handle_entity_update` function along with its now-unused imports (#261).
- **Demo GIFs** — Restored the original higher-quality demo recordings, reverting the earlier GIF compression.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Mouse support** — Click to navigate and interact with all overlays, modals, sidebar tabs, and table scrolling via mouse events. Includes parameterized selector click handlers and backend-aware confirm popup interactions (#216, #227, #228).
- **Bulk editing** — Select multiple issues or merge requests and apply batch operations (close, reopen, label, assign) in a single action (#215, #230).
- **Create MR/PR from issue** — Press `m` on a selected issue to instantly create a merge/pull request from it, with automatic branch creation and push (#185, #229).

- **Todos/Notifications tab overhaul** — Badges, relative `time_ago` timestamps, an explicit Updated column, and fuzzy search across all todo columns (#158, #239).
- **Milestone visual progress bar** — Replaces plain percentage text with a rendered progress bar in the milestones table column (#161, #238).
- **Configurable sidebar and terminal pane** — New `UiConfig` section in `config.toml` lets users set sidebar width and toggle sidebar/terminal pane visibility (#223).
- **Edit menu mnemonics footer** — Keybinding hints displayed at the bottom of edit menus for quick reference (#220).
- **Pipeline search and group-by** — Filter and group pipelines by Name, Event, SHA, and Actor columns (#221).
- **Run pipeline dialog** — Gated on backend availability with appropriate messaging when the feature is not supported (#222).
- **Related pipelines from MR detail** — Press `P` in MR detail view to list pipelines associated with the selected merge request (#212).
- **Manual GitLab job start** — Press `S` to start manual (blocked) GitLab CI jobs from the job view (#214).
- **Unified Modal component** — Reusable double-bordered modal widget for consistent overlay rendering (#210).
- **Auto-dismiss error toasts** — Error messages render as timed notification toasts instead of persistent overlays (#211).
- **BackendKind enum** — Runtime backend identification (`BackendKind::GitLab` / `BackendKind::GitHub`) with terminology helpers (`term()`) for host-aware UI strings (#206).
- **Semantic theme tokens** — Label palette, clean preset, and expanded color token system for finer-grained UI theming (#207).
- **workflow_dispatch inputs** — Detects and prompts for `workflow_dispatch` inputs when triggering GitHub Actions pipelines.
- **Performance optimizations** — Cached repo attributes, reduced over-fetching of unchanged data, and streamlined mutation handlers (#240).

### Fixed
- **GitHub PR draft toggle** — Fixed `gh pr edit --draft` (invalid command) → `gh pr ready --undo` for marking PRs as draft.
- **Help overlay completeness** — All missing keybindings now documented; overlay switched from hardcoded to config-backed rendering (#236).
- **Cache staleness** — Milestone issues no longer served stale; GitHub branch metadata correctly fetched (#235).
- **Quote stripping** — `extract_quotes` now only strips outer matching quote pairs instead of all quotes (#234).
- **Mouse click targeting** — Selector click handler properly accounts for search bar and footer height; search bar presence detected from `field_type` (#227).
- **Confirm popup with mouse** — Backend methods used for confirm action execution; event-sending bugs resolved (#227).
- **Keybinding modifier keys** — Bare `KeyCode` checks added for uppercase `P` and `S` modifiers to prevent conflicts (#227).
- **Pipeline keybinding wiring** — `view_related_pipelines` and `start_job` keybindings properly routed to their handlers.
- **Responsive column widths** — Table columns now adapt gracefully on 80-col terminals (#224).
- **Confirm popup and pipeline detail** — Missing confirm popup handling and pipeline detail adaptations restored (#219).
- **Milestone terminal output** — Unified close/reopen command output to prevent terminal corruption (#218).
- **GitHub job stage name** — Uses workflow name instead of raw job identifier for GitHub Actions stage column (#213).
- **GitLab milestone fixes** — Corrected milestone update and deletion behavior.

### Changed
- **In-terminal hints removed** — All inline status hints removed from the UI; functionality consolidated into the help overlay (`?`) (#226).
- **Edit menu terminology** — Standardized field labels using the new `FieldType` enum (#225).
- **Terminology extraction** — Hardcoded host-aware strings (Merge Request / Pull Request, Pipeline / Action, Todo / Notification) moved into `BackendKind::term()` for single-source-of-truth (#206).
- **CI release automation** — Submodules (`Formula/`, `scoop/`) removed; `post-release.yml` now updates Homebrew and Scoop manifests directly instead of dispatching to submodule repos.

### Dependencies
- Add `clap` 4 (with `derive` feature) — CLI argument parsing for subcommands
- Add `serde_yaml` 0.9 — YAML support for `doctor` diagnostics output

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- **Backend trait system** — Extracted a unified `Backend` trait (`src/backend/mod.rs`) with dedicated `GlabBackend` (`src/backend/glab.rs`) and `GhBackend` (`src/backend/gh.rs`) implementations, replacing the old `src/gitlab/` translation layer. The trait provides ~40 methods covering all API interactions with proper async dispatch (#165).
- **Domain model layer** — Consolidated domain types into `src/domain/` with clean modules for `branches`, `deployments` (Environment & Deployment), `issues`, `milestones`, `mr`, `notifications`, `pipelines`, `releases`, and `runners`, each with serde-powered structs and dedicated list/get helpers.
- **crates.io publishing** — Package renamed to `glab-tui-crate` (binary stays `glab-tui`) for publishing on crates.io; `cargo install glab-tui-crate` now works.
- **Homebrew & Scoop distribution** — Added `.gitmodules` for `homebrew-glab-tui` and `scoop-glab-tui` manifest repos, with CI automation to update formulas on release.
- **`async-trait` dependency** — Added `async-trait = "0.1.89"` to support the new async `Backend` trait.

### Fixed
- **is_draft detection** — Fixed draft status not being correctly parsed from GitLab MR responses.
- **GitLab nerd font icons** — Replaced custom nerd font GitLab icon with standard FontAwesome icon for better cross-terminal compatibility.
- **Repository argument encoding** — Removed spurious URL encoding from `glab` native subcommand `-R` arguments, fixing entity fetch failures when project paths contain special characters (#181).
- **Non-blocking CLI commands** — Reverted to non-blocking subprocess spawning to prevent UI freeze during CLI calls (#183).
- **Diff rename handling** — Fixed diff parsing when files are renamed, ensuring renamed file diffs are displayed correctly (#184).
- **Terminal output corruption** — Resolved extraneous printouts corrupting the terminal display (#173).
- **Trace view regression** — Fixed the job trace viewer that was not displaying output (#172).
- **Code injection mitigation** — Applied escaping fixes for CodeQL security alert #25 (shell argument injection) (#168).
- **macOS CI hangs** — Prevented `cargo test` from hanging on macOS runners by fixing PTY lifecycle.
- **Duplicate release notes** — CI now generates release notes only once in the matrix build.

### Changed
- **Architecture overhaul** — Removed the entire `src/gitlab/` module tree (client.rs, issues.rs, mr.rs, pipelines.rs, runners.rs, releases.rs, milestones.rs, notifications.rs, branches.rs, deployments.rs). Replaced with `src/backend/` (trait + per-host impls) and `src/domain/` (data types + logic). The `GitlabClient` now lives in `src/domain/client.rs` and delegates to the backend trait.
- **Package identity** — Cargo package renamed from `glab-tui` to `glab-tui-crate` to free the `glab-tui` name for the binary. The install command changes to `cargo install glab-tui-crate`.
- **Release automation** — CI `release.yml` now triggers manifest updates on Homebrew and Scoop submodules after a release publish.

### Dependencies
- Bump `toml` from `0.8` to `1.1.3+spec-1.1.0`
- Bump `tokio` from `1.52.3` to `1.53.0` (minor-updates group)
- Add `async-trait` `0.1.89`
- Bump `the patch-updates group` with 4 dependency updates
- Bump `docker/login-action`, `docker/build-push-action`, `actions/checkout` (CI)

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Nerd Font icon system** — All tab titles, status badges, labels, and UI indicators can now render nerd font icons. Uses hardcoded nerd font defaults that are not user-configurable. (original #156)
- **Pipeline / Action status in MR/PR pane** — The MR/PR details panel now displays the pipeline (GitLab) or workflow action (GitHub) status graphically with stage dots, adapting terminology to the remote host (#144, #126).
- **Confirmation prompts for destructive actions** — Closing issues, closing MRs, merging MRs, and deleting branches/releases/milestones now show a confirmation dialog before executing. Reduces accidental destructive operations (#141, #146).
- **Entity deletion** — Issues and merge requests can now be deleted directly from the TUI. New `delete_entity` keybinding added to the issues and MRs keybinding tables (#150).
- **Fetchable selectors for free-form fields** — Branch inputs, environment selectors, and other free-form fields were upgraded to fetchable `Selector` lists with fuzzy matching, matching the selector UX used elsewhere (#145).
- **Improved cache persistence** — Selector items and milestone issues are now persisted to disk cache alongside API payload data, reducing redundant network fetches on tab switches (#147).

### Fixed
- **Column widths bounded** — All table columns now use fixed `Length` constraints instead of `Fill`, guaranteeing every column stays within the terminal viewport. Affects issues, MRs, pipelines, jobs, runners, releases, todos, milestones, branches, and environments (#125, #155).
- **Config auto-create removed** — `Config::load()` no longer writes `config.toml` on startup when missing. The file is now created only by an explicit `save_view` / `save_layout` action, aligning with the documented behavior (#74daa1b).
- **Homebrew installation** — Fixed wrong version pinning and corrected the installation method in the Homebrew formula (#148).
- **E2E test deadlocks** — Resolved deadlocks in parallel PTY spawning by preparing process allocations before forking; refactored `test_cascading_repo_override` to use `Pty::spawn` (#fcb16b3, #4118699).
- **Install script asset matching** — `install.sh` now matches exact asset names to avoid downloading multiple release URLs (#c6acf24).

### Changed
- **Tab titles** — Now include nerd font icons (e.g., ` Issues`, ` PRs`, ` Pipelines`/` Actions`). Falls back gracefully on non-nerd-font terminals via config override.
- **Pipeline column in MRs** — Renamed to "Pipeline" on GitLab, "Action" on GitHub, gated by host detection.
- **Confirmation UX** — `ConfirmAction` enum expanded with `DeleteBranch`, `DeleteIssue`, `DeleteMr`, `CloseIssue`, `CloseMr`, `MergeMr` variants; new `confirm_popup_selected_yes` state field.

### Dependencies
- Bump `docker/login-action` from 3 to 4 (CI)
- Bump `docker/build-push-action` from 6 to 7 (CI)

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Save view configurations** — Inline page size editing, multi-page fetching, and config persistence validation in the configuration view (#142).
- **Milestone tracker & editing** — Support editing milestone fields, color-coded progress bars, caching milestone issues to avoid redundant network fetches, and dynamically rendering milestones column headers (#106, #110, #140).
- **Release creation & editing** — Support structured release creation and editing via `EditMenu`, along with commit metadata and assets link rendering in the release preview (#106, #110).
- **Issue, MR, and PR description templates** — Choose from description templates when creating new issues or merge/pull requests (#123).
- **Fuzzy matching improvements** — Upgrade pipelines, jobs, and branch/workflow selectors to use `SkimMatcherV2` fuzzy matching, matching the merge request list (#103).
- **Run pipeline workflow/branch selectors** — Autocomplete and search local/remote branches and CI configuration files when triggering pipelines (#103).
- **Packaging and manifests** — Add Docker container support, Scoop, and Homebrew formula packages with manifest auto-bumping utilities (#107).

### Fixed
- **GitHub PR Ready** — Use correct `gh pr ready` subcommand instead of the invalid `gh pr edit --ready` flag when marking GitHub PRs ready (#103).
- **Runner details panel** — Hide details pane if not applicable/empty (#109).
- **UTF-8 characters in labels** — Prevent panic on label truncation with multi-byte characters by ensuring truncation snaps down to character boundaries (#93).

### Changed
- Reordered Date column to the left of Release Name in the releases table.
- Moved collapse/expand matrix hint from jobs pane to help view.

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- **TOML config file** — `~/.config/glab-tui/config.toml` (or `$GLAB_TUI_CONFIG`) auto-generated on first run with all options documented inline.
- **Theme system** — choose from six bundled presets (`default`, `tokyo-night`, `gruvbox`, `nord`, `catppuccin-mocha`, `dracula`) via `theme_preset` in config; full per-color overrides supported under `[theme]`.
- **Custom theme files** — place additional `<name>.toml` files in `~/.config/glab-tui/themes/` to create and share your own themes.
- **Fully configurable keybindings** — every action across all panes is remappable in `config.toml` under `[keybindings.global]`, `[keybindings.issues]`, `[keybindings.mrs]`, `[keybindings.pipelines]`, and `[keybindings.releases]`.
- **Interactive calendar date picker** — press `Enter` on Due Date / Start Date in the edit menu to open an inline calendar widget; navigate with `h`/`l` (month) and `j`/`k` (day).
- **Due Date column in Issues** — new `Due Date` column in the issues table; hidden automatically when connected to GitHub.
- **Start Date column in Milestones** — new `Start Date` column; hidden automatically when connected to GitHub.
- **Runner details panel** — selecting a runner now opens a structured side-panel showing Runner ID, description, status, tags, and live job/queue metrics.
- **Per-pane column config in TOML** — set default visible columns, column filters, and group-by column persistently via `[issues]`, `[mrs]`, etc. sections in `config.toml`.

### Fixed
- **Small terminal handling** — gracefully degrade layout when the terminal is too small rather than panicking.
- **Pipeline job cache persistence** — pipeline jobs are now saved to and restored from disk cache.
- **Selector "Create New" entry** — always appears at the top of the list even when a filter is active.
- **Empty description on GitHub** — creating issues/MRs on GitHub no longer inserts a blank description field.
- **GitLab-only fields hidden on GitHub** — due date, weight, confidential, and start-date fields are excluded from GitHub issue/MR forms.
- **`Ctrl+E` to open editor** — unified shortcut to open `$EDITOR` for description fields across all edit menus.

### Changed
- **Config architecture refactor** — keybindings, column visibility, and themes were extracted from hard-coded constants in `ui.rs` into a dedicated `config.rs` module; `FormattingConfig` struct removed.
- **Keybinding matching** — all hardcoded `KeyCode::Char` match arms replaced with `keybinding_matches()` helper, enabling full runtime override from `config.toml`.
- **Edit menu UI polish** — edit popup border and title rendered in focused accent color; field values colored to match the details pane; date picker styled to match the details pane theme.
- **`cancel` pipeline keybinding** — default changed from `c` to `d` (resolves conflict with `download_artifact`, which was also `d`).
- **Runner tab layout** — rebuilt runner details rendering: removed old flat list in favor of a structured two-pane layout (table + details panel).

### Dependencies
- Bump `anyhow` from `1.0.98` to `1.0.103`
- Bump `ratatui` from `0.30.1` to `0.30.2`

- **Side-by-side diff layout** — toggle between unified and side-by-side with `d` in diff view.
- **Value-based column filtering** — filter table rows by specific column values via configure popup.
- **Column grouping & ordering** — merge grouping into configure view with ascending/descending sort.
- **Show read notifications** — toggleable via `show_read` parameter on todos/notifications tab.

### Fixed
- **ID sorting** — compare ID columns numerically instead of lexicographically.
- **Diff contextual naming** — show "Pull Request" or "Merge Request" based on host, not both.
- **Review pane focus** — focus files pane on Esc, confirm drafts when closing diff.
- **Line range selection** — correct line range and comment target on side-by-side diff.
- **UI rendering alignment** — align with sorted lists, resolve borrow checker conflict.
- **Row selection in grouping view** — restore normal selection, editing, and column toggling.

- Bump `softprops/action-gh-release` from v2 to v3

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-07

### Added
- **New MR creation from issue**: Branch selector with auto-create, slug-based source branch, auto-push before PR creation.
- **Reopen/close issues and MRs.**
- **Persistent offline caching** for all data tabs (issues, MRs, pipelines, runners, releases, todos, milestones).
- **1-minute auto-refresh** of the active tab.
- **Inline command logs** and a scrollable **Terminal tab** showing CLI command history.
- **Creation forms** for issues, MRs, and pipeline triggers.
- **Edit menus** with `$EDITOR` integration for descriptions and freeform fields.
- **Pipeline/JD job trace viewer** with scroll support and open-in-editor.
- **Self-updater** via `--update` / `-u` flag (GitHub releases).
- **Security audit** CI workflow (`cargo audit`).

### Fixed
- UI table overflow: main content pane now respects the terminal pane's reserved height.
- Windows: `NamedTempFile` handle locking — editor temp files use `into_temp_path()` to release the handle before spawning.
- Windows: removed `cmd /c` wrapper from editor spawn — Rust's command-line builder was double-escaping path quotes.
- GitHub mode: labels, milestones, description editing, and PR-from-issue creation.
- Fuzzy search: disabled fuzzy matching on all tabs except MRs; "Create New" option moved to top of selector.
- Self-updater: works correctly on both Linux and Windows.
- Various UI panics on empty lists, ellipsis padding, and rendering edge cases.

### Changed
- Refactored editor integration: extracted `Cli` / `UpdateCmd` helper structs for clean GitHub/GitLab CLI flag mapping.
- CI workflows now trigger only on `main` (dev branch triggers removed post-merge).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Dual-Engine GitHub & GitLab Support**: glab-tui now automatically detects if a project is hosted on GitHub or GitLab, translating TUI views and actions to `gh` or `glab` CLI commands under the hood.
- **CLI Configuration Options**: Added option flags `--repo <namespace>` (to override project context) and `--dir <path>` (to target a custom repository directory) on launch.
- **Columns Config Modal Overlay**: Replaced the sidebar panel with a centered columns checkbox toggler popup overlay, triggered by pressing `Tab` or `,`.
- **Hashed Multi-colored Labels**: Implemented individual label coloring based on a hashed color scheme in the Issues and Merge Requests tables, preserving fuzzy-search query highlights.
- **Runner Diagnostics Dashboard**: Integrated simulated performance statistics, utilizing gauges, utilization percentages, queue depths, and average queue wait times.

### Changed
- Expanded the Navigation sidebar pane to take full vertical height when columns config panel is hidden.
- Updated the Keyboard Shortcuts help menu to reflect the new `Tab` / `,` column toggle binding.
- Auto-formatted and cleaned up import structures across all code modules to fix compiler lint warnings.
